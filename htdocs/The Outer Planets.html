<p class=Jupiter>
	[Area: 61,418,738,571 km^2]</br> 
	[Mass: 1,898,130,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg]</br> 
	[Volume: 1,431,281,810,739,360 km^3]</br> 
	[Gravity: 24.79 m/s^2]</br>	
	[Days: 10 hrs]</br>
	[Years: 103,992 hrs]</br>
	Jupiter, the fifth closest planet from the sun and the largest planet in the entire solar system was named after the Roman god who was the king of gods.
	Due to its size it has approximately 80 moons and possibly even more!
	As a gas planet, it has a hydrogen atmosphere and mantle but metallic, and a molten rock core.
	And in its atmosphere, it can have storms with wind speeds reaching 900 km/h.</br>
	Fun Fact: Jupiter has a large red storm the size of two earths and has been going on for 150 years!</br>
	Fun Fact: Jupiter actually has rings made of dust, therefore it’s hard to see!
</p>
<p class=Saturn>
	[Area: 42,612,133,285 km^2]</br> 
	[Mass: 568,319,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg]</br> 
	[Volume: 827,129,915,150,897 km^3]</br> 
	[Gravity: 10.4 m/s^2]</br>
	[Days: 11 hrs]</br>
	[Years: 258,216 hrs]</br>
	Saturn, the sixth closest planet from the sun and is considered the “most beautiful” planet in our solar system and was named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture.
	It has 83 moons but only 53 were named.
	Identical to Jupiter, it has a hydrogen atmosphere and mantle but metallic, and a molten rock core.
	And it has many rings made of ice, dust, and rock particles</br>
	Fun Fact: Saturn has a storm in its north pole in the shape of a hexagon!</br>
	Fun Fact: One of Saturn’s moons, Titan, has an atmosphere! 
</p>
<p class=Uranus>
	[Area: 8,083,079,690 km^2]</br> 
	[Mass: 86,810,300,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg]</br> 
	[Volume: 68,334,355,695,584 km^3]</br> 
	[Gravity: 8.87 m/s^2]</br>
	[Days: 17 hrs]</br>
	[Years: 736,488 hrs]</br>
	Uranus, the second farthest planet from the sun, without counting Pluto, and is known as the sideways planet because it tilted by 90°, was named after the Greek god of the sky.
	It has 27 moons, 13 inner moons, 5 major moons, and 9 irregular moons.
	Again, it has a mostly hydrogen atmosphere and mantle but metallic, and a molten rock core.
	And it has 10 relatively dark rings made of water and ice.</br>
	Fun Fact: Uranus’s magnetic pole is actually tilted to its equator by 150° instead of 90°!</br>
	Fun Fact: Instead of being a gas giant its actually one of two ice giant because its are mostly comprised of ice!
</p>
<p class=Neptune>
	[Area: 7,618,272,763 km^2]</br> 
	[Mass: 102,410,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg]</br> 
	[Volume: 62,525,703,987,421 km^3]</br> 
	[Gravity: 11.15 m/s^2]</br>
	[Days: 16 hrs]</br>
	[Years: 1,444,560 hrs]</br>
	Neptune, the farthest planet from the sun, not including Pluto, and because its so far from the sun its the coldest planet was named after the Roman god of the sea.
	It has 14 moons, 7 regular moons and 7 irregular moons.
	It also has a mostly hydrogen atmosphere and mantle but metallic, and a molten rock core like the rest of the outer planets.
	And its also another ice giant because of its composition mostly made of ice.</br> 
	Fun Fact: Much like Jupiter, it also has hard to see ring due to it being of dust and its distance and was only confirmed until 1989!</br> 
	Fun Fact: Because it’s a little smaller than Uranus, Neptune is also the smallest outer planet!
