	Mercury, the closest planet from the sun and the smallest inner planet was named after the Greek god, well Mercury god of commerce, messenger of the gods.
	And because of it's size it has no moons or satellites. 
	It has a rocky crust, a silicate mantle, and a iron core.
	And in total, it's made up of approximately 70% metal and 30% silicate material. </br>  
	Fun Fact: Though the closest planet to the sun, it's not the hottest planet in terms of its surface temperature. That would be Venus!</br>
	Fun Fact: Mercury has the most craters from asteroids and comets of all planets!

	Venus, the second closest planet from the sun and the most toxic planet was named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.
	Similarly to Mercury, it does'nt have any moons or satellites.
	It has a thin rocky crust, a hot rock mantle, and a iron core similar to earth, with a thick atmosphere mostly made of carbon dioxide.
	And due to it's atmosphere, it traps the heat from the sun making it the hottest planet in terms of it's surface temparature. </br>
	Fun Fact: Venus is the brightest object seen from earth, third from the sun and the moon.</br>
	Fun Fact: Due to the similarity of venus and earth, they are some times refered as sister planets!

	Earth, the third closes planet from the sun and the water filled planet was named from the old english words eor(th)e and ertha. 
	It has one reflective moon, well our moon.
	And similarly to venus, it has rocky crust, a silicate rock mantle, and a iron outer and inner core.
	It's also one of the two planets in the goldilocks zone and with 70% of it's surface is made of water, earth is the only planet with life, that we know of though.</br>
	Fun Fact: Earth is the largest from the inner planets!</br>
	Fun Fact: It is the only planet in our solar system where water can be found in the three state of mater!

	Mars, the fourth closes planet from the sun and also known as the "red planet" was named after the roman god of war.
