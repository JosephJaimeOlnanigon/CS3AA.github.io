	The asteroid belt is the space that divide the inner and outer planets between Mars and Jupiter. 
	Many astronomers think that the asteroid belt is made of material that wasn't able to form a planet, or the remains of a planet which broke apart long time ago.
	This is also where most of the asteroids in our solar system can be found. </br>
	Fun Fact: Ceres, the largest asteroid in the asteroid belt with a diameter at around 950km, can be considered as a Dwarf Planet!</br>
	Fun Fact: The 4 largest asteroids Ceres, Pallas, Vesta, and Hygiea make up about 50% of the asteroid beltâ€™s mass!</br>
	Fun Fact: There is about 1,100,000 to 1,900,000 steroids in the Asteroid belt that are more than one kilometer in diameter, there are millions more smaller asteroids.</br>
	Fun Fact: The total mass of all the Asteroids out in the Asteroid belt is only less than 4% of the total mass of our moon.</br>
	Fun Fact: There are so much space in the asteroid belt that each asteroid are approximately 950,000 km away from each other!</br>

<p class=Kuiper>
	The Kuiper belt is a elliptical ring made of frozen rock and metals near the orbit of Uranus and was named after the Dutch astronomer Gerard Kuiper. 
	One of the objects in the Kuiper belt is the now dwarf planet Pluto.</br>
	Fun Fact: Saturn and Neptune got at least one of their moons from the Kuiper belt!</br>
	Fun Fact: The dwarf planet Pluto is the largest object in the Kuiper belt! </br>
	Fun Fact: Because the Kuiper belt is elliptical, its is 4,500,000,000 to 7,400,000,000 km away from the sun!</br>
	Fun Fact: The Kuiper belt has an retractable atmosphere that appears the farther it is from the sun!</br>
	Fun Fact: There is a snowman shaped object in the Kuiper belt called Arrokth!</br>
